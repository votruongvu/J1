"""RAGAnything provider settings.

Mirrors the shape of every other `j1.*.settings` module — frozen
dataclass + env-driven loader. Honours the `J1_*` convention.

The three `*_processor` fields are import strings (e.g.
``"mypkg.processors:compile_doc"``) that name a deployment-supplied
callable. When set, the adapter resolves the callable via the safe
class-loader and uses it instead of the built-in stub. This is the
recommended way to wire RAGAnything against a real
`raganything` install.

    pipeline vs. talk to a service. Today only "local" is wired.

    `*_processor` fields each name an importable callable. When set,
    the matching adapter delegates to it — turning "you must subclass
    the adapter" into "you can wire it via env". The callable
    receives the `RAGAnything*Request` value object documented next
    to each adapter and returns the canonical `ArtifactProcessingResult`
