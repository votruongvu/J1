    ``document_id`` + ``run_id`` are the per-run scoping inputs the
    bridge uses to select which LightRAG workspace to query.
    Per-run isolation means:

      * ``RunScope(run_id=X)`` validation queries → read from
        ``{workdir}/runs/{tenant}/{project}/{doc}/X/``.
      * ``ActiveScope(document_id=D)`` queries → the engine resolves
        ``active_run_id`` from the document registry and passes it
        as ``run_id``; same routing as above.
      * ``WorkspaceScope`` (project-wide) → no per-run override;
        falls back to ``settings.workdir`` (the legacy unscoped
        graph). This case is rare for graph QA but kept for
        backward-compatibility.

    Both fields are optional — direct test callers can omit them
    and the bridge uses the legacy unscoped workdir.
