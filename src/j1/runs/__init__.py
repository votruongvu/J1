"""Ingestion-run persistence + progress reporting.

The `runs` package layers a user-facing progress surface over the
existing Temporal-backed workflow + audit infrastructure. It does NOT
replace either: workflows remain the orchestration engine, the audit
log remains the persistent event store. `IngestionRun` records and
`ProgressEvent`s are projections / additional records that make the
ingestion lifecycle navigable by a frontend without reading workflow
history or audit JSONL directly.

Public surface:

  * `IngestionRun` / `RunStatus` — the persistent run-record
  * `IngestionRunStore` / `JsonlIngestionRunStore` — store interface
    + JSONL-backed implementation (mirrors `JsonlAuditSink`)
  * `ProgressReporter` — Protocol the workflow / activities call
  * `AuditProgressReporter` — writes through the existing
    `AuditRecorder` so events are visible in the audit log + via the
    existing `GET /ingestion-jobs/{id}/events` endpoint
  * `TemporalHeartbeatReporter` — pumps compact progress into Temporal
    activity heartbeats so the operator UI can see liveness
  * `CompositeProgressReporter` — fan-out to multiple targets
  * `NoopProgressReporter` — for unit tests

    Fans out to:
      * `AuditProgressReporter` — writes through the deployment's
        `AuditRecorder`, persisting events into the workspace audit
        log (where the `/ingestion-runs/{id}/events` endpoint reads
        them).
      * `TemporalHeartbeatReporter` — pumps compact summaries into
        Temporal activity heartbeats so operator UIs (Temporal Web,
        worker logs) see liveness on long-running activities.

    Importing this from a deployment entrypoint avoids each
    deployment re-discovering the right composition. Tests can pass
    `NoopProgressReporter()` directly instead.
