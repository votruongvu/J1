Temporal workflow + audit log: an `IngestionRun` is one row per
document-ingestion attempt, and a `ProgressEvent` is one entry in
that run's timeline.

 (terminal)

 `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION` is reached only when the deployment
 has opted into manual confirmation (auto-run is the default; the
 confirmation gate is configured per-run via the ingest request).

 `PAUSED` and `CANCELLING` are operator-driven intermediate states.
 PAUSED is reversible (resume → RUNNING). CANCELLING is one-way:
 the workflow is winding down, will land at CANCELLED at terminal
 once any in-flight activity finishes.

 `COMPILE_PENDING` and `VERIFYING` are intermediate states for the
 two-phase compile model. The workflow parks at `COMPILE_PENDING`
 after assessment finishes; `POST /ingestion-runs/{id}/compile`
 advances it to RUNNING. `VERIFYING` runs immediately after the
 compile activity to gate chunk-count / index health checks; a
 failure here lands at terminal FAILED with one of the
 `FAILURE_CODE_*` reason codes.

 Canonical-vs-legacy names: `RECEIVED`, `ASSESSMENT_READY`, and
 `COMPILING` are the canonical names introduced by the
 macro-stage simplification ( of the workflow refactor).
 `CREATED`, `PLAN_READY`, and `RUNNING` remain as readable
 legacy values for runs persisted by older worker builds — new
 runs SHOULD be written with the canonical names. See
 `canonical_status` and `LEGACY_TO_CANONICAL_STATUS` for the
 translation table; downstream callers (REST status filters, FE
 predicate sets) treat each pair as equivalent."""

 The `run_id` is the public identifier the frontend uses; it's

 Mutability: this dataclass is mutable on purpose — the in-memory
 record is updated as the run progresses (status, current_stage,
 current_step, progress_percent, etc.) and the JSONL store
 appends a fresh snapshot on each update. Readers reconstruct the
 latest state by replaying the log.

 New document-centric fields are optional with safe defaults so
 every legacy on-disk snapshot deserialises cleanly:

 * ``run_type``               — see ``RunType`` literal above.
 * ``document_version_id``    — pointer to the specific
   ``DocumentVersion`` that was processed. ``None`` for
   legacy runs (the backfill stamps these where it can).
 * ``parent_run_id``          — when ``run_type`` is ``resume``
